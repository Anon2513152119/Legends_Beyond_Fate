*if outfit = "medic_uniform"
    Your trench-coat billowing in the breeze as you walk gives you an air of importance, but the moment the common-folk see
    your horns, they huddle into groups of hushed whispers. There is no doubt in your mind that they are ridiculing you,
    for your asymmetrical head and for your attire. Some of them sneer and laugh in your face, but you are unphased.

    ...Rather, you [i]would[/i] be unphased, had Raserei not grabbed the offending civillians by the collar and snarled in
    their faces for them to either shove their venomous words back into their "shit-spewing faces" or end up drier than
    a "hag burnt on a stake".

    With as much heat as Ras was producing, the clothing of the people he grabbed singed under his fingertips. His flaming
    hair burnt white with rage as he spat at the offenders and indignantly huffed as he returned to your side.

    You bring a tired hand to your head. So much for being discreet.

    It was not like Raserei could be discreet in the first place. He is a fire elemental - tempermental, judgmental. Hells,
    with the way he acts and dresses, he could be mistaken for the Fire Elemental King's Heir. It wouldn't be too surprising
    if that proved to be true, but it would definitely worsten the headache you've got so far.

*elseif outfit = "vampire_hunter"
    Your cloak perfectly conceals your face and your armour from the townsfolk, but that does little to quell their fearful
    whispers. A pale traveller covered in a black cloak during broad daylight gave the people all they needed to know.
    
    [i]It isn't safe here.[/i]

    You rush gracefully through the streets, dodging anyone in your way. [i]They[/i] noticed you running.
    The Van Hellsing vampire hunters give chase, springing from alleys and springing from whichever direction.
    Their blood pumps so thickly, so [i]sweetly[/i] through their veins. Your undead heart pounds as you hyperfocus
    on their heartbeats. You shake off your stupor and run like the wind, heading for the shipyard and docks at the water's edge.
    
    Your desperation alerted the bat swarm to come to your aid, the dark cloud of angry - [i]annoyed[/i]
    and [i]interrupted[/i] - chirping mammals clawing and scratching the offending hunters, buying you valuable escape time.

    If only you had more time...

    Alas, now is not the time for contemplation or lament over what could have been. Your legs carry you with newfound urgency,
    such that you clamber up the side of a building and leap across rooftops to reach your destination.

    *page_break To the docks!

    You jump off the final rooftop and your knees buckle when you land, but that is no cause for concern. You right yourself and
    rush to the the pirate ship's captain. He was your only hope right now, and you [i]know[/i] he won't refuse you since you have
    more than enough coin to bargain with. Besides, the pirates still owe you favours from your previous jobs with them.

    You call to him, "Captain!"

    He raises an arm, beckoning you closer. You hasten your approach as you consider your destination from the mainland.
    A brillant thought comes to you - a memory of a conversation with one of the travelling hunters. Something about a golden-eyed,
    silver-haired monster hunter in the southwest that fought with magic, twin longswords, and potions. That monster-hunter
    piqued your curiosity - he seemed to be just like you from what you've heard; no longer human but still on their side.

    Your eyes widened. This was the perfect opportunity to meet with a man much like yourself.

    You had pressed the hunter to give you the names of major port cities in the territory of the silver-haired
    sword-slinger, threatening him with your fangs millimetres from his neck. The man eagerly cooperated with
    you.

    "Cintra, take me to Cintra!"

    He senses the urgency in your voice and commands the crew to raise anchor and chart course for the shores of Cintra. Both you and he
    jump aboard and hurry along the chaos. By the time the vampire hunters shook off your pet bat swarm, you were too far
    to reach from shore.

    Van Hellsing raged at your escape while your swarm carried to you a massive bag of store bought fruit and coin they stole
    from the hunters. You smirk at your pets, grinning at all the ways you can extort the pirates for the treatment of their
    scurvy, adding yet another debt they owe you.

*else
    *if Race = "Damned"
        You are not exactly hidden from the masses, but it is clear by your posture and by the way you walk that others are not
        to bother you. The scantily clad flame elemental trailing you is another story. He is openly gawked at and gossiped about.
        A travelling stranger with his summon - the Fire Element embodied was one of the kinder things you heard from them.
        The rest were looking to steal Raserei from you or called him your bitch.

        You suppress a venomous glare in the direction of the gossip.
    *elseif Race = "Vampire"
        You look standard enough not to rouse too much suspicion, but the people are wary and the hunters are vigilant. You can't
        hide well enough from them. Since you've decided not to wear your armour, you are vulnerable to any attacks. On the bright
        side, you have the advantage of speed and stealth like this. If any situation were to arise, you could always summon the
        armour onto yourself. However, the fact remains that right now, you are vulnerable to surprise attacks.
